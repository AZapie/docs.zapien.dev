To start taking apart the the joystick, remove the screws on the bottom side of the controller.

> Note: You may have to remove three rubber pads to access more screws.

After cracking it open, we can observe the structure of the controller. The controller is divided into to halves: the joystick half, and the stick & swivel sides.

After unscrewing & removing the swivel mechanic and removing the pcb underneath the buttons, we can start dissecting how the hardware to this controller functions. This page focuses only on the chronology of how I disassembled the controller to provide possible further insight on the rationale behind me decisions.

After taking off the pcb for the buttons, I also took off and took note of the three pcbs for the central orange button. Each one was the same as the other.

Moving onto the other joystick half, things were as simple as unscrewing the entire component and then taking off screws to be able to pry off the wiper pcb that the joystick works off of
