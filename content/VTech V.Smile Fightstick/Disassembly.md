After cracking it open, we can observe the structure of the controller. The controller is divided into to halves: the joystick half, and the stick & swivel sides.

After unscrewing & removing the swivel mechanic and removing the pcb underneath the buttons, we can start dissecting how the hardware to this controller functions. This page focuses only on the chronology of how I disassembled the controller to provide possible further insight on the rationale behind me decisions.

Moving onto the other joystick half, things were as simple as unscrewing the entire component and then taking off screws to be able to pry off the wiper pcb that the joystick works off of
